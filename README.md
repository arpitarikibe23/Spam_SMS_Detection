ðŸ“² SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the Naive Bayes classifier for efficient spam detection.


# Project Objectives
1) Classify SMS messages into two categories: Spam (unwanted/junk) and Ham (legitimate).
2) Preprocess and clean text data using NLP techniques to prepare it for machine learning.
3) Build a spam detection model using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and TF-IDF vectorization.
4) Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
5) Deploy a prediction function to classify new/unseen SMS messages with high confidence and accuracy.


âœ… Task Objectives
1) Build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.
2) Use NLP techniques for text preprocessing and vectorization.
3) Ensure high accuracy and interpretability with proper evaluation metrics.
4) Provide an easy-to-use prediction function for new SMS inputs.
5) Visualize the dataset and model performance.


# Steps to Run the Project (Google Colab)
1) Clone the repository or download the code from this link (https://github.com/arpitarikibe23/Spam_SMS_Detection.git)
2) Open the spam_sms_detection.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
3) Upload the dataset file Upload the file spam_sms_detection.csv when prompted.
4) Run the notebook cells in order:
Import libraries
Load and clean the data
Train the model
Evaluate the model
Test the prediction function
