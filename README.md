ðŸ“² SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the Naive Bayes classifier for efficient spam detection.

âœ… Task Objectives
1) Build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.
2) Use NLP techniques for text preprocessing and vectorization.
3) Ensure high accuracy and interpretability with proper evaluation metrics.
4) Provide an easy-to-use prediction function for new SMS inputs.
5) Visualize the dataset and model performance.
